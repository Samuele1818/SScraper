- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
We do not accept these types of changes generally cause for these functions we rely on [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf).
